### CHATBOTS
Chatbots are artificial intelligence systems that we interact with via text or voice interface. Those interactions can be straightforward, like asking a bot about weather report, or more complex, like having one troubleshoot a problem with your internet service.


### HOW DOES CHATBOTS WORK?
Are chatbots really that intelligent? How do they answer questions we ask for? No, they are not intelligent itself, humans make them do so. Chatterbots recognize keywords from the userâ€™s input and access the database for giving a predefined response.

### ARE CHATBOTS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY?
Messaging apps are now bigger than social networks. With the rise of messaging apps and chatbots, the way we are using social media to interact and share is changing.

### HOW ARE CHATBOTS BUILD?
As discussed above, there can be 2 types of bots: one that follows rules and other which is smarter does machine learning. So for building chatbots either take a rule-based approach, the developer will be coding rules for the system. Another approach can be machine learning, which requires a massive amount of steaming data and the system will have to learn on its own.
